# my-random-password-generator

## Description
In this homework i refactored starter code to make a password generator functional, it is made up of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. i used the "confirm" function to give the user the option of which ones they would like to select. I'm going to have fewer commits as i had something happen and had to make a new repo entirely.

## Installation
N/A

## Credits
I didnt think this was necessary to add this but i found a way to concatenate my character sets as a string instead of using an array fir each set. i found doing it this way through googling and none of my other classmates did it this way, or at least any that i spoke to. So i just wanted to add some links with the information i found so i dont get docked!

## Usage
To operate this website just hit the "Generate Password" button and it will ask you to pick a character length between 8 and 128. It will then ask whether or not you want to include numbers, special characters, uppercase, and lowercase letters and base the random password on the information you provide.
